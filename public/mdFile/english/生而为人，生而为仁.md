A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes & went directly to the surgery block. He found the boy's father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled:

在接到一通紧急手术的电话以后，一名医生急匆匆地走进医院。他一听到电话马上就接了，换了衣服，径直走到手术区域。他看见患者的父亲在走廊焦急地来回踱步等待着医生，一看见医生便咆哮道：

"Why did you take all this time to come? Don't you know that my son's life is in danger? Don't you have any sense of responsibility?"

你怎么这么久才来？知不知道我的儿子危在旦夕？你还有没有点责任心？

The doctor smiled & said:

医生面带微笑说道：

"I am sorry, I wasn't in the hospital & I came as fast as I could after receiving the call...... And now, I wish you'd calm down so that I can do my work"

“我很抱歉当时我不在医院，接到电话以后我也尽可能快的赶来了，现在你需要冷静，我要开始我的工作了。

"Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would you calm down? If your own son dies now what will you do??" said the father angrily

冷静？！如果现在手术室里面的是你的儿子，你会冷静么？如果你自己的儿子要死了，你会怎么做呢？这位父亲生气的说道。

The doctor smiled again & replied: "I will say what Job said in the Holy Book "From dust we came & to dust we return, blessed be the name of God". Doctors cannot prolong lives.

医生依然面带微笑回答道：我会说，约伯在《圣经》里曾说，承蒙上天关爱，我们源于尘土也终将归于尘土。

The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy,"Thank goodness!, your son is saved!" And without waiting for the father's reply he carried on his way running. "If you have any question, ask the nurse!!"

手术进行了几个小时，之后医生高兴地从里面走出来。“感谢上帝，你的儿子得救了！“还没有等父亲回答，他就一路小跑走了“如果你有任何问题，问护士吧。”

"Why is he so arrogant? He couldn't wait some minutes so that I ask about my son's state" Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left.

几分钟后父亲看到护士抱怨道，“他为什么如此傲慢，也不等个几分钟让我问问儿子的情况”

The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: "His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was in the burial when we called him for your son's surgery. And now that he saved your son's life, he left running to finish his son's burial."

“他的儿子昨天出交通事故去世了，我们打电话让他手术的时候他正好在善后，现在他救好了你儿子就要赶回去参加葬礼。”说着护士留下了眼泪。

Moral - Never judge anyone..... because you never know how their life is and what they're going through"

这个故事告诉我们：不要轻易评价一个人，因为你了解他们的人生也不知道他们此刻正在经历什么。
